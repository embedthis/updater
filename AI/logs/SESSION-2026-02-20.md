# Session 2026-02-20

## Goals
- Update AI/ documentation to reflect current project state (v1.1.4)
- Document the pending premake5 migration plan in context and plans index

## Completed
- Updated AI/context/CONTEXT.md with current version, premake5 migration reference, and project status
- Rewrote AI/plans/PLAN.md as a concise plans index listing PREMAKE.md as pending
- Updated AI/logs/CHANGELOG.md with today's documentation changes

## In Progress
- Premake5 migration (AI/plans/PREMAKE.md) -- plan created, all 4 tasks pending, awaiting approval

## Notes
- DESIGN.md was reviewed but requires no changes -- it documents the updater architecture which is unaffected by the build system migration
- PREMAKE.md plan covers T1-T4: core build conversion, README update, build/test/verify, and release/tag/finalize
- Target version after premake migration: 1.2.0

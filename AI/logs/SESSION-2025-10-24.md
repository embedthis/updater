# Session Log - 2025-10-24

## Session Overview

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Focus:** AI directory migration
**Status:** Complete

## Activities

### AI Directory Migration
- Renamed `.agent/` directory to `AI/` per updated `../CLAUDE.md` specification
- Created Claude Code integration directories:
  - `agents/` - Claude sub-agent definitions
  - `skills/` - Claude skill definitions
  - `prompts/` - Reusable prompts
  - `workflows/` - Development workflows
  - `commands/` - Custom commands
- Renamed `context/current-status.md` to `context/CONTEXT.md` (if existed)

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure
- `.agent/` â†’ `AI/` (renamed entire directory)
- Created `AI/agents/`
- Created `AI/skills/`
- Created `AI/prompts/`
- Created `AI/workflows/`
- Created `AI/commands/`

## Notes

This migration aligns the documentation structure with the updated requirements in `../CLAUDE.md`:
- **AI/** instead of `.agent/` for better visibility and Claude Code integration
- **Claude Code directories** (agents, skills, prompts, workflows, commands) for AI integration

## Next Steps

- Update README.md to reflect AI naming and new structure
- Populate Claude Code directories as needed

# EmbedThis Updater

The EmbedThis Updater is a command-line utility and library for downloading and applying device software updates published on the [EmbedThis Builder](https://admin.embedthis.com).

## Description

Devices can use the **updater** command or library to enable Over-The-Air software update capabilities. The EmbedThis Builder offers hosting and global distribution for updates, policy-based update distribution, and gradual rollout and control of updates. Additionally, graphical metrics and reporting are available.

## Variants

This repository provides different versions of a standalone **updater** program.

* A C code command line utility
* A NodeJS command line utility
* A C updater library for integration in your programs

A shell script sample **updater.sh** is also provided. This must be customized with necessary arguments.

## Device Agents

The [Ioto](https://www.embedthis.com/ioto/) device agent includes the updater functionality internally. The [Appweb](https://www.embedthis.com/appweb/) and [GoAhead](https://www.embedthis.com/goahead/) web servers include this repositiory under their **src/updater** directories.

All devices using other embedded web servers and device agents can include this Updater to include OTA software update functionality.
